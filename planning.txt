Create a simple pomodoro app that has its basic funcitonality and a simple interface.
1. A pomodoro timer that has an initial value at 25 mins.
2. stop and start timer at default value time. (25 mins and 10 mins)
3. A simple responsive design using HTML, CSS and Javascript. (animation also)
4. I think animation and timer should be a seperate file.

I think this is a good way to refresh your memory with HTMLDOM.
